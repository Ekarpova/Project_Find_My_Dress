# Project_Find_My_Dress
This project is demonstarion for a use of Siamese Neural Network (Twin Network) and its capability of comparing images.
Use case demonstrated here is for the model to identify similaruty or dissimilairty between 2 dresses. 
The concept:
A customer is serching for a dress he/she can find closest match for the item in search and get suggestions of the most similar dresses.


Model
Siamese neural network with the Constrastive loss function. Euclidian distance is athe distance metric for comparing the output feature vectors.

Data:
The model is trained on very small data set.
