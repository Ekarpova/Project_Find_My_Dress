# Project_Find_My_Dress
This project demonstrates the use of Siamese Neural Network (Twin Network) and its capability of comparing images.
Use case demonstrated here is for the model to identify similarity or dissimilarity between 2 dresses.
Use case:
A customer is searching for a dress he/she can find the closest match for the item in search and get suggestions of the most similar dresses.


# Model
Siamese neural network with the Contrastive loss function. Euclidean distance is the distance metric for comparing the output feature vectors.

# Data:
The model is trained on a small sample dataset to illustrate the concept.
