# Project_Find_My_Dress
This project is demonstarion for a use of Siamese Neural Network (Twin Network) and its capability of comparing images.
Use case demonstrated here is for the model to identify similaruty or dissimilairty between 2 dresses. 
The concept:
A customer is serching for a dress, using this model a person can find closest match for the item in search and get suggestions of the most similar dresses

Models used
Used a Convolutional Siamese network along with the Constrastive loss function. I chose Euclidian distance as the distance metric for comparing the output feature vectors.
